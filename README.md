### • My application website for FAC21 • ###

I have created this one-page website as part of my application to the *[Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/)* spring 2021 cohort.

It is written entirely in HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. It does not use a Github theme or any JavaScript or CSS libraries like Bootstrap or jQuery or use an image carousel package like Flickity.

Deployed version [here](https://sevdas.github.io/portfolio/)

*Founders and Coders is a London-based, peer-led, social-impact-focused coding bootcamp, read all about it.*
